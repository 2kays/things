;; Concepts:
;;  * STATE - array of strings (lines), the buffer contents
;;  * CURSOR - x, y, constrained to the bounds of the state
;;           cursor is moved for standard editing commands
;; 
;; TODO:
;;  * Unit tests!!!
;;  * Multiple ncurses windows: buffer (with scrolling), modeline
;;  * Handle meta key properly, with more complex keymaps
;;     - Currently we can handle C-, M- and C-M- prefixes.
;;  * Potentially implement major/minors? I want to have modes for editing, but
;;    also for general stuff like no-input, unbounded cursor movement, etc.
;;  * Primitive CL mode with a SWANK client!
;;  * Colours!
;;  * Convert to CLOS? Modes might be a lot easier
